# We'll now fetch the UKBB LD matrices from Prive et al. 
# These are LD matrices filtered by the HapMap3 variants and we'll use them to generate our RÃ¡pidoPGS models.

mkdir ../data/LD

# We used the code below to fetch the matrices, but since we already have them from a different project, we'll simply copy them
#mkdir ../data/LD
#cd    ../data/LD
#
#wget https://ndownloader.figshare.com/articles/13034123/versions/3 -O ukbbmat.zip
#unzip ukbbmat.zip
#rm ukbbmat.zip

# However, since we already have them from a different project, we'll simply copy them
